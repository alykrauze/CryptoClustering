# CryptoClustering

 Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes

 Finding the best value for K using original data, clustering the currencies with K-means by using the original data, optimizing clusters with PCA, finding best value for k using PCA analysis, cluster crypto currencies using K-means by using PCA data 

 Impact of using fewer features allows you to analyze the data, can make it easier to interpret, better visualization, and improved generalization
